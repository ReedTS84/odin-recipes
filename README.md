This is an excercise to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired so far. In this project, you I'm are going to build a basic recipe website.

The website will consist of a main index page which will have links to a few recipes. The website wonâ€™t look very pretty but the looks of the website will improve in later classes.
